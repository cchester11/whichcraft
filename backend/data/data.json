Fifteen years ago, a Burgundian winemaker happened to be in Oupia, tasted Iches wines, and was so enthused that he convinced Iche to bottle and market his production. Since then, Iche has become an eternal twenty-year-old."

Cuvee des Barons and Nobilis are 60% Syrah and 40% Carignan, from a selection of old vines in the best plots, and are aged in Bordeaux barriques for 20 months. They are slower to evolve than the Cuvee Tradition, and exhibit more elegance and restraint, but similar dark berries and spicy aromas."
